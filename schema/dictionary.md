## Table: employees

| column name   | type        | notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| employee_id   | char(36)    | UUID string: unique ID of employee |
| ssn_suffix    | char(4)     | last 4 digits of employee's SSN |
| last_name     | varchar(80) | employee's last name |
| first_name    | varchar(80) | employee's first name |
| date_of_birth | date        | employee's date of birth |

| start_date    | date        | start of insurance coverage |
| term_date     | date        | end of insurance coverage, NULL if not ended |


* Employees past and present exist in the `employees` table
* Employees that are currently active have a NULL `emp_end_date`; employees that have terminated (quit, retired, or let go) will have a non-NULL `emp_end_date`

* Employees may have an `emp_end_date` and/or `term_date` in the future, if they've put in their notice in the future
* Employees that elect to maintain their benefits past their `emp_end_date` (via COBRA) have a different `term_date`


## Table: dependents

| column name   | type        | notes |
|---------------|-------------|-------|
| dependent_id  | char(36)    | UUID string: unique ID of dependent |
| employee_id   | char(36)    | UUID string: refers to employee from employees table  |
| ssn_suffix    | char(4)     | last 4 digits of dependent's SSN |
| last_name     | varchar(80) | dependent's last name |
| first_name    | varchar(80) | dependent's first name |
| date_of_birth | date        | dependent's date of birth |
| start_date    | date        | start of insurance coverage |
| term_date     | date        | end of insurance coverage, NULL if not ended |

* Dependents of employees that have been terminated will have a non-NULL `term_date` that matches the `term_date` of the employee's coverage (including COBRA if applicable)
* Dependents of employees that have been terminated, but do not elect to be on the employee's COBRA coverage will have a `term_date` matching the employee's `emp_end_date`


## Table: retirees

| start_date    | date        | start of insurance coverage |
| term_date     | date        | end of insurance coverage, NULL if not ended |


* Retirees will have a `start_date` matching their employee record's `emp_end_date`, if they elect to be covered under the company's retirement plan
* Retirees that do not elect to be covered under the company's retirement plan will have no record in the `retirees` table
* Retirees that have a NULL `term_date` are actively covered under the plan
* Retirees that elect to discontinue their coverage under the company's plan will have a non-NULL `term_date`
* The retirees' `term_date` is not the same as the employees' `term_date`

| claim_amount  | decimal(10,2) | dollar amount being claimed |


* Each claim has a unique `claim_id`
* If a claim is for an employee, the `claimant_type` will be "employee" and the `claimant_id` will be the employee's `employee_id`
* If a claim is for an dependent, the `claimant_type` will be "dependent" and the `claimant_id` will be the dependent's `dependent_id`
* If a claim is for an retiree, the `claimant_type` will be "retiree" and the `claimant_id` will be the retiree's `employee_id`
